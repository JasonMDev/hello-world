Jason here, I'm starting out in *coding*. 
Little by little I'll learn more.
Concentrating on Ruby on Rails.

### This is a block of code by indent
Description:
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
        
### This is a block of code by syntax highlighting
Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with GitHub Flavored Markdown:        
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
### This is a inline code
Description
Concentrating on '< Ruby on Rails.>'
'$ git commit -am "Description."'

###Blockquotes

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
